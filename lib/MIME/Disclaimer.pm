=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $md = MIME::Disclaimer->new(
    plain => 'Disclaim this',
  );
  $md->parse( \*STDIN );
  $md->add;
  $md->entity->print;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds disclaimer text to both the beginning and ending of an
email message. It is a subclass of L<MIME::Signature>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new>

Constructs a L<MIME::Disclaimer> object with the same arguments as L<MIME::Signature>
with the exception that delimiters are overwritten if not passed. The delimiters
are changed to the following:

=over 4

=item plain_delimiter: C<\n>

=item enriched_delimiter: C<\n>

=item html_delimiter: C<< <br /><hr /> >>

=back

=item C<add>

Adds the disclaimer text to both the beginning and end of the message with the
L<MIME::Signature::prepend> and L<MIME::Signature::append>.
